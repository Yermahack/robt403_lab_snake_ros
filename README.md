# ROBT 403: Laboratory

## Laboratory 3 
### Task 0 - Prerequisites [The 5 DOF planar robot packages were downloaded and compiled.]

The project was implemented on Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS machine with ROS Melodic. To be able to run the project, the following package must be installed (for ros-melodic):

  - git clone [https://github.com/KNurlanZ/snake-noetic.git](https://github.com/KNurlanZ/snake-noetic.git)

### Task 1 - Move a joint of the planar robot
"Create a rosnode that will “listen” for std_msgs/Float64 type data and “publish” this data to the joint of the planar robot. The node should send the command to move if the any new incoming value is higher than the previous one"
