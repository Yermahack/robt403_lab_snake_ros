# ROBT 403: Laboratory

## Laboratory 3 
### Task 0 - Prerequisites [The 5 DOF planar robot packages were downloaded and compiled.]


The project has been implemented on Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS machine with ROS Melodic. To be able to run the project ROS must be installed on your local machine. Also, the following libraries are required:

  - MoveIt
  - Download effort controller: sudo apt-get install ros-YOUR_ROS_DISTRIBUTION-ros-control ros-YOUR_ROS_DISTRIBUTION-ros-controller
  - Clone dynamixel-motor into src folder: git clone [https://github.com/KNurlanZ/snake-noetic.git](https://github.com/KNurlanZ/snake-noetic.git)
  - 
### Task 1 - Move a joint of the planar robot
"Create a rosnode that will “listen” for std_msgs/Float64 type data and “publish” this data to the joint of the planar robot. The node should send the command to move if the any new incoming value is higher than the previous one"
